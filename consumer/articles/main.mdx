## Know when to break the rules

<DocLink id="docsGuidelines" />

Guidelines are great, but at the end of the day, you need to make sure you
always do what makes the best sense for your users, even if that means sometimes
ignoring the guidelines. This is a living document. Please water it regularly
with feedback and updates.

## Terminology

Refer to the
[Writing style guide](https://brand.elastic.co/302f66895/p/194a3b-writing-style-guide/t/159934),
[Naming guide](https://brand.elastic.co/302f66895/p/072ccc-naming-guide), and
[Voice and tone](https://brand.elastic.co/302f66895/p/30bdc7-voice-and-tone).

## File names and page IDs

Choose your page ID carefully. As a general rule, after you publish a page you
should not change its ID.

It's a very good idea to have source file names match page IDs. For example, a
page with `id: mlAnomalyDetection` in its front matter should be saved as
`mlAnomalyDetection.mdx`. Matching these names makes it much easier for people
to update the appropriate source file.

Ideally, each source file contains content for only one output file. The
exception to this recommendation is when the file contains content that's
re-used in multiple pages (such as a list of common parameter descriptions).

## Slugs and URLs

The URL for each page is defined by the mandatory `slug` field in the front
matter. For the purposes of search engine optimization (SEO), the slug:

- Must be lower case
- Must not contain special characters other than a hyphen(`-`)
- Should use hyphens to separate terms
- Should contain keywords from the page title or subject area
- Should avoid abbreviations

<DocCallOut title="Do">
  `use-this-slug-style`
</DocCallOut>

<DocCallOut color="warning" title="Don't">
  `useThi$slugSt4le`
</DocCallOut>

It is a best practice to keep the URL length as short as reasonably possible
(ideally less than 80 characters) and always human-readable.

As a general rule, after you publish a page you should not change its slug. If
you do, you should also create redirects in case Kibana or other websites link
to that URL.

## Titles

Use sentence case for page and section titles. Sentence case is easier to type
and read.

<DocCallOut title="Do">
  Capitalize headings in sentence case
</DocCallOut>

<DocCallOut color="warning" title="Don't">
  Capitalize Headings In This Style
</DocCallOut>

Write short, descriptive titles. Keep in mind that by default the page title is
also used for the search and navigation title.

## Sections

Do not use heading level 1 (`#`) in the body of your page. The `title` in the
page's front matter generates the "H1" title in the output. Therefore, if you
add sections to your page, always start with a heading level 2 (`##`).

You can add up to six heading levels, but only the level 2 and level 3 sections
appear in the right-hand ("On this page") navigation. Therefore when you're
creating your page, consider the best possible groupings/sections for your
content so that readers can use the links to jump ahead or back as necessary.

Do not skip heading levels (for example, don't skip from a 2 to a 4).

## Linking

Avoid excessive use of inline links. Too many links can be distracting and
direct the user away from the topic's main point.

## Screen captures

Use screen captures or screenshots sparingly. Screen captures are time consuming
to create, get stale over time, and are difficult to translate.

## Admonitions and callouts

Use admonition blocks ( or _callouts_) as defined in <DocLink id="docsSyntax" />) to draw attention to blocks of text in your content.

DANGER and CAUTION admonitions are generally reserved for things that could cause physical harm.

For software products like ours, it's not people who are at risk so much as data:

**Warnings**
<DocCallOut color="danger" title="Potential data loss">
  You could permanently lose data or leak sensitive information.
</DocCallOut>

**Important notifications**
<DocCallOut color="warning" title="Performance impact">
  Ignoring this information could impact performance or the stability of your
  system, but your data is not at risk.
</DocCallOut>

**General notes**
<DocCallOut title="You should know">
  Here's a relevant piece of information, but there are no serious
  repercussions if you ignore it.
</DocCallOut>

**Tips**
<DocCallOut title="Here's a tip">
  This is advice intended to help you make better choices in using a feature.
</DocCallOut>

## Content types

The Elastic documentation contains different types of pages, each with their own audience, purpose, and guidelines.

See <DocLink id="contentTypes" />.

### Glossary

The glossary is an alphabetical list of terms specific to Elastic,
with definitions for those terms.

#### Terms to include

- Include terms that your audience might not be familiar with&mdash;or
that have a specific meaning in Elastic.

- Don’t define words that are industry standards.

- If a term is defined differently in different apps, use
the same entry, but separate by paragraph and start with the app name.

#### How to write the definitions

- Write a short sentence description of the term, using plain language.
Try to keep the description to two sentences or less.

- If you include an initialism, such as RUM in Observability,
use “See Real User Monitoring” for the description, and then put
the definition with the spelled out entry.

- If you use other glossary terms in the description, create appropriate
links to that term in the glossary.

- Where possible, end with a link to the documentation where the reader
can get more details.

- Avoid using the word in the definition.

#### Examples

saved search

: The query text, filters, and time filter that make up a search, saved for later retrieval and reuse.

scripted field

: A field that computes data on the fly from the data in Elasticsearch indices. Scripted field data is shown in Discover and used in visualizations.
